# MostlyHarmful

## A research proposal in anti-racist solidarity:

### Who I am:

My name is Jake Ashdown. I've been working as a software developer since 2016 and I'm currently employed by a subcontracter to the DLR.
I'm experienced mainly in developing websites and databases. I was born in the UK and but I've been living in Munich since January 2019.
I'm struggling to learn German.

### What I'm currently working on:

I am currently creating a website which works like a mobile phone app (https://mostlyharmful.org/home). The purpose of the app is to help users navigate any interaction with the police.
The key feature is an interactive walkthrough based on a model of the legal system in the user's country. This will make the user aware of their legal rights, and operate in the best interests
of members of the public. We hope to make this walkthrough as accessible and easy-to-use as possible, especially for young people who may not have had previous contact with law enforcement. The app could also offer an easy way to get further help if neccessary, by calling Rote Hilfe or encouraging the user to call their guardian when they are not yet a legal adult.

In addition to guiding users through the encounter, the app also allows collection of anonymised data such as the identities of the officers involved, statements they make, and location,
as well as optional ethnicity data from the user. This data will be accessible to the user if they require evidence of police overreach or excessive force. I also hope to include a secondary location tracking function to the app. This will regularly upload the user's location data to a public server, identifiable only by a nickname, for a preset length of time.
This could be useful to someone who is wary of being the victim of arrest, such as a political demonstrator, since it would allow others to dertermine which police station the demonstrator was taken to. This could expand to include streamed audio recording.

### What I hope to acheive:

As well as operating to the benefit of the user, the app generates a publicly-accessible database of police encounters. Given sufficient use of the app withing an area, this data could put to interesting use.

For example, using location data we could generate a time-space map of police encounters. This would enable users to avoid heavily policed areas. By linking encounters by the identities of
officers involved, it would become clear who is complicit in abuse of powers and racial bias.

Although I understand that this not legally protected in Germany, if we were to collect identifiable images of officers and apply the machine learning toolkits published by
technology companies, this would enable facial recognition of police officers. This would be helpful in prosocuting occurences of police violence where the officers are not easily identifiable,
such as riot police used at demonstrations. This would also reduce the threat posed to organisations by the infiltration of out-of-uniform officers, such as political groups and underground concerts.

In a similar way, we might record data from traffic stops by unmarked police cars. Analysing this data would allow us to better inform the public of how the police operate.

Since this data would be freely accessible, members of the public can easily put this information towards their own uses.

### How I intend to operate:

I beleive this project can only succeed if it operates on a fully anti-racist basis. Given that encounters with law enforcement are so frequently fatal for Black and
Minority Ethnic people, it is imperative that this project serves as a platform for black voices. I aim to operate as a committed ally to the BME community, and serve their needs as well as possible.

Additionally, I would like to design this software on an open-source basis. With the explicit design goals of ease-of-modification and -setup, this means that this project could be freely copied and adapted for use in countries other than Germany. To ensure this, I plan to launch initially in parallel for both Munich and London. I imagine a beta-testing phase to involve around 100 users across both locations.

Another key design goal is on user anonymity. All data collection will be completely transparent, non-identifiable for the user, and opt-in. The user can identify themselves from the public database using just a nickname. This enables them to find their data. No other data specific to the user (other than possibly ethnicity) will even be collected by the app. This should streamline GDPR compliance.

No advertising or tracking of the user will be used.

### An invitation:

I am looking for an interested member of the BME community in Munich to step into this project in a 'product owner' role. This would involve setting requirements for development, and accepting or rejecting the shipped product (in this case, the app and the public database). Ideally this person be able to fill more roles within the project with BME individuals, in order to optimise it's use as a platform to support marginalised people.
