## Design goals

Without going into specifics, the design of this software should maximise accessability for developers unfamiliar with the project. Care should be taken to use popular languages and frameworks with shallow learning curves, in order to encourage replication and adaption. Operation of the software should be automated to the greatest extent, with straightforward configuration and deployment.

Data which identifies the user shall not be collected, other than the nickname provided and optionally ethnic data, and only ever with informed consent. Encrypted data transportation shall be used wherever possible, and data indicating a user's device such as IP address must never be logged.

## Technical notes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

### Lint

Run `ng lint --fix` to lint and fix the code.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Requests to this URL will redirect to an 'under construction' page. The home of the actual app can be seen by going to 'http://localhost:4200/home'.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
