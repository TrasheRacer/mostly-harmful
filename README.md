# MostlyHarmful v1.0
An online assistant for interaction with law enforcement.

## Description

### What does this project do?
This project aims to create a responsive web application which assists the user when interacting with law enforcment officials.
#### Mobile phone
The mobile phone version of the application proivdes the user with assistance.
A tag-based UI can be used to provide:
* nature of the interaction (pulled over, stop and search, ...)
* anonymous demographics of the user (PoC, disabled, ...)
* identities of officials involved (badge number, name, ...)
* official vehicles (registration plate, make, colour, ...)

The flow uses this information to provide the user with appropriate legal advice.
The user may also upload everything to our server.
Metadata such as location and time will also be collected with consent.
Each user has a replacable randomly-generated nickname with which they can identify themselves.
#### Laptop or desktop computer
From a computer, this application provides access to uploaded data.
A user can search records within a country by nickname.
#### API
Access to the API is available to the public for research purposes.

### Why is this project useful?
#### Providing a service for the user
This project aims to change the balance of power between law enforcment officials and the general public in favour of the latter.
Officials receive schooling on the subject, and so are usually better informed on the law than the public.
Due to a lack of oversight, it is clear that officials themselves cannot be trusted to implement this law fairly, truthfully and without prejudice.
By providing free and accurate legal guidance, we offer users an impartial resource to help deal with confrontations by police.
Allowing the upload of data to a server provides the user access to evidence which may be in their favour.
This may be useful in the event of further legal action.
#### Enabling research
Use of this app will generate a public-access anonymous database providing a comprehensive picture of policing based on first-person accounts.
Analysis of demographic data may provide quantitative answers to questions such as ¨how much racial bias exists within the police force?¨.
#### Building practical tools
There does not seem to be any existant public-access database mapping out the day-to-day interactions of law enforcement and the public.
The database we hope to generate would be first, and would allow for exciting new possibilities.
For example, it would be simple to use collected data to produce a ´cop forecast´ for users, showing where and when their city is ´hot´.
This could be useful to marginalised groups who are at particular risk of police violence.
Application of modern data-mining techniques could prove interesting.
